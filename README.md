# Laboratory work â„– 2: Installing Linux

I decided that it would be more interesting to install a new Linux distribution on my personal laptop rather than on a virtual machine (previously Ubuntu was installed on it).

Installed from an installation flash drive.


Using the arch wiki in Russian and English, and using the tips of a colleague, I bootstrapped arch linux. Not all attempts are on the video. After successful installation, I repeated the process 2 more times to consolidate my knowledge. Later I tried to install gentoo, and I am still trying.

After that, I started setting up the router. I didn't have the login details for the router's web interface, so I called Rostelecom. They suggested that their technician forward the ports remotely. He didn't succeed. In the end, they gave me the data from the router's admin panel and I tried it myself. In theory, everything should have worked, but when my colleague tried to connect, he still received the message: "Connection refused".
